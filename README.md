# Project5
Project work for week 5 of the cmu course. This course focussed on MySQL, HBase and MongoDB.

Below tasks were accomplished during this course. 

# Task 1
Implement login functionality on the home page using MySQL DB. Java servlet interacts with MySQL to authenticate the user.

# Task 2
Store user-follower relationship in HBase and write a Java servlet to find all the followers of a given user. 
There could have been a little more introduction to HBase.

# Task 3 
Store all the comments by the user in Mongo DB and write a Java servlet to find all the comments of a given user.

# Task 4 
Combine all the above to implement a Timeline feature. 
Write a Java servlet to return a JSON response containing the user profile picture, followers of the user and all the comments of the users that the given user is following.
The comments should also contain Parent and Grandparent comments if any.
